\begin{cvparagraph}
%---------------------------------------------------------
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I use molecular simulations and machine learning methods to study the self-assembly of proteins and nanoparticles into complex structures.
I both lead and contribute to a number of open-source Python and C/C++ projects in my research area, including freud, HOOMD-blue, and signac, and have contributed to other tools in the SciPy stack.
I have experience optimizing code in various languages and on both CPU and GPU architectures, and I have made use of tools like CuPy, cuDF, and numba to do so in Python.
