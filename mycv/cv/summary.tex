I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I use molecular simulations and machine learning methods to study the self-assembly of proteins and nanoparticles into complex structures.
I have experience with both coarse-grained and atomistic molecular modeling as well as the application of numerical methods to scientific problems.
I am also experienced in integrating molecular modeling with machine learning methods to better inform and accelerate the the research pipeline.
I am the lead developer of a number of open-source projects in my research area and have contributed to numerous other well-known tools like SciPy.
