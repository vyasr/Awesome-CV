I am a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I use molecular simulations and machine learning methods to study the self-assembly of proteins and nanoparticles into complex structures.
In addition to this research, my prior work has included studies of the binding capabilities of zinc finger nucleases and the conformational changes in the EcoR124I transcription factor, as well as large-scale data analysis of genomic data to characterize evolutionary rates.
In my role as a scientific software developer, I serve as the lead developer of a number of open-source projects in my research area, and I also contribute to other well-known tools like SciPy.
