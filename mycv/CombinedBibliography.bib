  abstract	= {The freud Python package is a library for analyzing
		  simulation data. Written with modern simulation and data
		  analysis workflows in mind, freud provides a Python
		  interface to fast, parallelized C++ routines that run
		  efficiently on laptops, workstations, and supercomputing
		  clusters. The package provides the core tools for finding
		  particle neighbors in periodic systems, and offers a
		  uniform API to a wide variety of methods implemented using
		  these tools. As such, freud users can access standard
		  methods such as the radial distribution function as well as
		  newer, more specialized methods such as the potential of
		  mean force and torque and local crystal environment
		  analysis with equal ease. Rather than providing its own
		  trajectory data structure, freud operates either directly
		  on NumPy arrays or on trajectory data structures provided
		  by other Python packages. This design allows freud to
		  transparently interface with many trajectory file formats
		  by leveraging the file parsing abilities of other
		  trajectory management tools. By remaining agnostic to its
		  data source, freud is suitable for analyzing any particle
		  simulation, regardless of the original data representation
		  or simulation method. When used for on-the-fly analysis in
		  conjunction with scriptable simulation software such as
		  HOOMD-blue, freud enables smart simulations that adapt to
		  the current state of the system, allowing users to study
		  phenomena such as nucleation and growth. Program summary
		  Program Title: freud Program Files doi:
		  http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/v7wmv9xcct.1 Licensing
		  provisions: BSD 3-Clause Programming language: Python, C++
		  Nature of problem: Simulations of coarse-grained,
		  nano-scale, and colloidal particle systems typically
		  require analyses specialized to a particular system.
		  Certain more standardized techniques -- including
		  correlation functions, order parameters, and clustering --
		  are computationally intensive tasks that must be carefully
		  implemented to scale to the larger systems common in modern
		  simulations. Solution method: freud performs a wide variety
		  of particle system analyses, offering a Python API that
		  interfaces with many other tools in computational molecular
		  sciences via NumPy array inputs and outputs. The algorithms
		  in freud leverage parallelized C++ to scale to large
		  systems and enable real-time analysis. The library's broad
		  set of features encode few assumptions compared to other
		  analysis packages, enabling analysis of a broader class of
		  data ranging from biomolecular simulations to colloidal
		  experiments. Additional comments including restrictions and
		  unusual features: 1. freud provides very fast parallel
		  implementations of standard analysis methods like RDFs and
		  correlation functions. 2. freud includes the reference
		  implementation for the potential of mean force and torque
		  (PMFT). 3. freud provides various novel methods for
		  characterizing particle environments, including the
		  calculation of descriptors useful for machine learning. The
		  source code is hosted on GitHub
		  (https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud), and documentation is
		  available online (https://freud.readthedocs.io/). The
		  package may be installed via pip install freud-analysis or
		  conda install -c conda-forge freud.},
