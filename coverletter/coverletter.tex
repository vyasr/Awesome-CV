\begin{cvletter}
    I am writing because I believe that my combination of experience with both experimental drug delivery and computational molecular modeling research makes me an ideal candidate for the position of Computational Scientist at Verseon.
    My current work involves the use of coarse-grained molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations along with machine learning methods to study the self-assembly of nanoparticles, colloidal particles and proteins.
    A typical example of my work is a recent publication describing a novel approach I developed for simulating anisotropic particles.
    This result exemplifies how I could contribute to the full drug discovery cycle at Verseon, from theory to algorithmic considerations and finally to high-performance implementation.

    Prior to my PhD research, my two most recent research projects were the study of conformational changes in proteins using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and the experimental characterization of polymer phase behavior in a lung cancer drug delivery system.
    The former was crucial to helping me hone my knowledge of atomistic models and understand the interface of molecular modeling with quantum mechanics, particularly QM/MM approaches.
    Meanwhile, the latter project was critical to understanding how to connect fundamental scientific principles to a practical, medical application, a skill that would be critical working at Verseon.

    As part of my research I have also gained extensive experience as a scientific software developer that would be valuable to building out Verseon's drug discovery platform.
    I maintain \emph{signac} (a NumFOCUS affiliated project) and \emph{freud}, two well-known tools in molecular modeling community, and I am part of the core team of \emph{HOOMD-blue}, one of the fastest molecular simulation tools known especially for its pioneering support for GPU-enabled simulations.
    In addition, I have created a number of smaller packages (such as the \emph{rowan} package for quaternion mathematics) and have contributed to some standard components of the Scientific Python software stack such as SciPy. 
    Building robust, reusable, and efficient software pipelines for scientific research is critical to achieving the flexibility and scalability needed for a high-throughput research approach such as yours, so my software expertise would provide a strong complement to my scientific background for a job at Verseon.

    I am currently in the process of preparing most of my research work for various publications and will soon be defending my PhD.
    Thank you for your consideration for this position, and I look forward to hearing from you.
